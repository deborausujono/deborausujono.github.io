<div markdown="1">
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.ics.uci.edu/), advised by [Prof. Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/). My research interests are in variational inference and probabilistic programming languages. Previously, I worked as a junior data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/). I received my MS in Computer Science from the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Daniel Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/), and my BA in Computer Science and Linguistics from [Hampshire College](https://www.hampshire.edu/). Outside of research, I enjoy yoga, rock climbing, and traveling to tropical diving destinations.
